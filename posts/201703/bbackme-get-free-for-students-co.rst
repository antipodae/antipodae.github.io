The service provided by `bback.me <https://bback.me>`_ costs €5 a year, which accounts for
hosting and development fees. Five euros a year is not much per se, but for
some of you it is still to much for a service which does not fill a dire need.

Thus, in addition to the free test period of three months that allows you to
test the service, we decided to offer a free service to students and to other in need.

Just subscribe to `bback.me <https://bback.me>`_ and then send a mail to ``webmaster@bback.me``
explaining your situation, and why you think you are in the category of people
who can not spend €5 a year for such a service. We will then gracefully
proceed and give you a free extension of one year to begin, if your mail
convinced us.

Be careful to use the same mail address than the one you have used to subscribe.
