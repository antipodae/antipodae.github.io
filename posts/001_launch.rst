   Some objects are precious to us.
   Not that they cost a lot, but they may carry a good memory, have some
   sentimental value or more simply, be essential to our day to day
   life — *keychain, credit card, phone, handbag*, but also, *baby's
   comforter, luggage or coat*.

We have all experienced the troubles of having lost one of our belonging and
their impact on our day to day life, either because of the costs incurred or
the additional administrative burden.
   
Sometime, we also find a forgotten garment, a key or even a laptop 
on public transportation. We would like to help, but have no way to get in
touch with their owner.

  Having experienced those situations, and being convinced that the human being
  is good by nature and is willing to help, we set up a system which would
  allow people finding lost items to easily get in touch with their owner.

The main idea — which is not new in itself — is to mark the objects with an ID
which allows people finding them to get in touch with the owner. The novelty
is to use an ID which is an internet address (URL), and which is easily
recognizable as such.

http://bback.me

   We have thus designed the web site http://bback.me. You may browse and
   read the `main page <https://bback.me>`_ and the `FAQ
   <https://bback.me/manage_/faq>`_ to know more.
   
Outlined, the specificities of the service are:

- Cheap, with an annual registration fee of €5. The idea is to be able to pay
  for hosting and development, but not more.
  
- Everybody can choose the URL they think will be easily reckoned or
  understood by the person who will find the lost item.
  
  Thus in English spoken country, one would probably use ``bback.org``,
  ``bback.me`` or ``lost.re``. In France, ``cqi.fr`` or ``rendre.fr`` would be
  more appropriate whereas ``kwijt.nu`` would be used in Netherlands. 
  The domain ``hooz.it`` is also available.

- We do not provide labels to put on your belongings. It is indeed difficult
  to design label suitable for all possible use. You can use whatever mean to
  mark your objects.
  
  We frequently use labels printed with an `adequate printer 
  <https://bback.me/manage_/faq#how-can-i-mark-my-objects>`_ (bought €20
  online), or `textile labels
  <https://bback.me/manage_/faq#do-you-sell-labels>`_.

   On the technical side, the website is written in Python with the help of
   the `Web2py framework <web2py.org>`_. It is hosted on *Google App 
   Engine*.
