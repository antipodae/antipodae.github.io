`Bback.me <https://bback.me>`_ is now free for everybody!

.. class:: ad

   After some months of testing, we deem it wise to open the service to more
   people by making it free for all and relying upon donations to keep the
   service online.

.. TEASER_END

.. class:: ad

   If you don't already know it, the main idea of *bback.me* is to mark the
   objects with an ID which allows people finding them to get in touch with
   the owner. The novelty is to use an ID which is an internet address (URL),
   and which is easily recognizable as such.

Everybody can choose the URL they think will be easily reckoned or
understood by the person who will find the lost item.
  
For example, in an English spoken country, one would probably use ``bback.org``,
``bback.me`` or ``lost.re``. In France, ``cqi.fr`` or ``rendre.fr`` would be
more appropriate whereas ``kwijt.nu`` would be used in Netherlands. 
The domain ``hooz.it`` is also available.

.. class:: ad

   Thus, everybody has now access to the service *bback.me*
   starting with 5 objects. It is of course possible to acquire more
   IDs by making a donation.

And of course we still do not display ads nor sell or distribute your private data.

.. class:: ad

   Do not hesitate to try it, make some feedbacks and of course share on your networks.
